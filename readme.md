In an effort to have small and readable files the the naming convention allows to have an 
intuition of the hierarchy of the code from alphabetical order of files.

For this reason we use the following convention for the prefixes:

* ``1_`` compile time utilities
* ``2_`` pure algorithms
* ``3_`` general parametrizations of functions
